##  What is iWantFood?

iWantFood is a website designed to quickly provide UK students with places that they want to eat around Lexington.

## How does iWantFood work?
iWantFood asks for three criteria:
<ol>
<li>Your budget</li>
<li>Which UK landmark you're walking from</li>
<li>How far you're willing to walk</li>
</ol>
It then uses information from Google Maps to link you applicable restaurants. Once you find one that you like, just click on it, read the details, and you're off!

## Why use iWantFood?
iWantFood provides two main utilities for users:
### Quick and easy results
iWantFood cuts searching for a restaurant down to the essentials - price and location. Anybody who's wanted to find a different restaurant quickly has gone through the menu navigation struggle. 
### Real, anonymous reviews
iWantFood also allows for users to read and write anonymous reviews for their local restaurants that give the power back to consumers. While review aggregate websites like Yelp and Google Reviews give owners the ability to delete any negative review for any reason, iWantFood allows for anyone's experience to be shared and archived, completely anonymously, no account needed.
